# Wolf Armor Plus (WIP!)

## Overview
Our mod is designed to build upon the "Armored Paws" update from Minecraft 1.20.5, extending the ideas behind but for 1.21 onwards.
It adds additional custom armor types to protect your companions and provides additional armor types over the vanilla armadillo armor.
